        <h3>Programming Skills</h3>
        <p>I've been coding in some form or another since I was 7 years old, and in that time I've become competent in both fundamental programming principles and in language-specific syntax</p>
        <p>I do most of my coding in <b>Python</b> because it's simple, prevalent, and acceptably performant (for my use case)</p>
        <p>In 2022, I published a <a href="https://colourlessspearmint.itch.io/soaring-squirrel-shipment">video game about flying squirrels</a> that I built using <b>Unity</b>. I also have a tiny bit of experience making games in <b>Godot</b></p>
        <p>I wrote my <a href="https://colourlessspearmint.github.io">personal website</a> myself using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks</p>
