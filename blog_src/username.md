description: An explanation of my username, ColourlessSpearmint
---

This site's URL is [`colourlessspearmint.github.io`](https://colourlessspearmint.github.io/). The `.github.io` part is because it's hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the `colourlessspearmint` comes from my username, [ColourlessSpearmint](https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint).

My username is primarily a reference to a story by [Sam Hughes](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8352985.Sam_Hughes), one of my favorite authors, called [*There Is No Antimemetics Division*](https://qntm.org/scp). One of the chapters is titled "[CASE COLOURLESS GREEN](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/case-colourless-green)"

The 'spearmint' comes from my favorite colour, <span class="mint">Spearmint Teal</span>
