Metric or Imperial? Those are the two ways to measure distance.

On the one hand, Metric is the international standard, it's what (most) computer software uses by default, and it divides better than Imperial.

But on the other hand, Feet are simply a more convenient length than Meters. Also, I'm American, so the vast majority of the people I interact with use Imperial, making it more useful.

I prefer Metric and use it whenever possible, but I'm aware that using it has the unfortunate side effect of making me seem like a contrarian elitist.

So imagine my delight when I had an idea for a completely new system that nobody uses based on common knowledge like quantum metaphysics!

## What is a Planck Length?

For the rest of the article to make sense, you'll need a basic understanding of why the Planck Length is so important. For the sake of brevity I'm going to wildly oversimplify a lot of things.

According to modern physics, energy comes in discrete packets called **Quanta**. By the way, this is where the word 'quantum' comes from.

Because there is a 'smallest amount of energy' (quanta) and a 'smallest amount of mass' (quark), this means that it's impossible to move something smaller than the distance that one quark travels if you move it with one quanta of energy. Smaller distances do exist, they just don't really matter.

This distance is called a **Planck Length**, and it's commonly described as the pixel size of the universe.

The Planck Length is a **fundamental constant**, which is just a physics word for 'very important number'.

Good measurement systems (like Kelvin) are based on fundamental constants (absolute zero), and bad ones (like Fahrenheit) are based on imprecise arbitrary nonsense ("colder than it gets in Norway").

## Planck Magnitudes

All of this started in mid-2024 when I was multiplying and converting the Planck Length by exponentiated magnitudes. I was bored, okay?

Anyways, I noticed that 10^38 (or 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) Planck Lengths is equal to ~1.00429431 miles.

This got my attention.

10^38 Planck Lengths is really close to a mile. A mile is a convenient length. Therefore, 10^38 Planck Lengths is a convenient length.

Hmm.

What if we use a smaller magnitude? 10^34 Planck Length is ~6.36320876 inches. This is reasonably close to half a foot. 2x10^34 is ~1.06053479 feet.

So by multiplying the most important distance (Planck Length) by the most important number (10) enough times, we get convenient lengths that are *really* close to those of the Imperial system.

## Unit Abstraction

Of course, it isn't that simple. Even at my most naive, I couldn't expect normal people (or even nerds) to say "I'm 103,721,256,856,127,281,896,237,392,354,257,836 Planck Lengths tall."

The solution is to create a new unit, defined as 10^34 Planck Lengths (~6.3 inches). Then you would just say "I'm 10.37 (new unit) tall".

The question then becomes: 'what do we call this new unit?'

## Unit Names

First of all, the unit needs to be one syllable. Nobody (including me) would use it otherwise.

Here are a few ideas for 10^34 Planck Length (~6.3 inches) unit:

- **Mark**: This is the first name I thought of because apparently I'm an eponymous narcissist.
- **Plonck**: Etymologically related to 'Planck'; fun to say
- **Quanth**: A portmanteau of 'quanta' and 'length'; also fun to say

I'm leaning towards Quanth right now, so I'll tentatively call it that for the rest of the article.

## Prefixed Units

To describe distances other than ~6.3 inches, we apply SI prefixes to Quanth, just like with Meters.

| Unit           | Planck Lengths | Quanth           | Imperial Approx   | Metric Approx     |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Microquanth**| 10^28          | 0.000001 Quanth  | 1/158000 Inches   | 161 Nanometers    |
| **Milliquanth**| 10^31          | 0.001 Quanth     | 1/158 Inches      | 161 Micrometers   |
| **Quanth**     | 10^34          | 1 Quanth         | 6.3 Inches        | 161 Millimeters   |
| **Kiloquanth** | 10^37          | 1,000 Quanth     | 525 Feet          | 161 Meters        |
| **Myriaquanth**| 10^38          | 10,000 Quanth    | 1 Mile            | 1.61 Kilometers   |
| **Megaquanth** | 10^41          | 1,000,000 Quanth | 1,000 Miles       | 161 Kilometers    |

I suggest that we abbreviate 'Myriaquanth' (~1 mile) as 'Myr' (pronounced like in '**mir**ror') in common usage. So you would say "The road is 5 Myr long."

## Conclusion

I think that the Quanth elegantly bridges the gap between logic and convenience; between scientists and the average person.

Imagine a world where everyday intuition and scientific precision align, where human-scale units are informed by the universe's pixel.

...

Of course, that'll never happen and I don't expect anyone to use my system I just thought it was cool okay bye
