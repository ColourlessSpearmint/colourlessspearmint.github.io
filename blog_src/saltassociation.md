Salt is my favorite mineral. It's easily the most delicious (Cryolite probably comes in second. Despite the name, [Cinnabar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnabar) is actually not tasty at all), it [looks awesome under an electron microscope](https://salinity.oceansciences.org/images/ed_image_81_salt_crystal.jpg), and it's so abundant that it forms colossal salt caverns and vast salt flats.

Yesterday (June 10, 2025), I discovered that the top result on Google Images for ["Salt Flat"](https://www.google.com/search?q=salt+flat&udm=2) is this beautiful photo of the [Uyuni Salt Flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni). It is currently set as my desktop wallpaper.

Although the image content is interesting, what interested me even more was the image source: a website called "The Salt Association". Intrigued, I clicked on the link.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but in any case I was delighted to find [an entire multi-page website devoted entirely to salt](https://saltassociation.co.uk/). 

## The Salt Association

![The word "SALT" is spelled out using four different types of salt on a dark background: coarse white salt for 'S', pink Himalayan salt for 'A', black salt for 'L', and fine white salt for 'T'](https://149576366.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/salt-text-in-salt.jpg)

The Salt Association's website explores a variety of topics, including [the basic properties of salt](https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/what-is-salt-and-its-properties/), its [applications in de-icing roads](https://saltassociation.co.uk/de-icing/), its [culinary use as table salt](https://saltassociation.co.uk/white-salt/), its [history as a valuable commodity](https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/salt-history/early-history/) that soldiers were paid in (the word 'soldier' comes from the Latin 'sal dare', meaning 'to give salt'), and much more.

It explains [how salt is mined](https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/make-salt/), where the [biggest salt reserves are](https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/physical-geography/), and the [different types of salt](https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/chemistry-salt/) other than Sodium Chloride.

It covers various [famous geological salt formations](https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/physical-geography/), like the salt flats that brought me to this website in the first place.

It even covers [salt controversies](https://saltassociation.co.uk/position-statement-government-salt-reduction-strategy/) and combats [salt misinformation](https://saltassociation.co.uk/salt-the-facts/).

![A 404 page with the header "404 Error" in large red text, and below it the subheader "You’ve found a lost salt crystal!" in smaller blue text. To the right is a photo of a salt crystal.](../../images/salt_404.webp)

The [404 page](https://saltassociation.co.uk/404) says "You’ve found a lost salt crystal!". I thought [my 404 page](https://colourlessspearmint.github.io/any_invalid_url_actually_goes_to_the_404_page_but_this_one_works_too) was great, but this one is clearly far superior.

## Conclusion

This website is absolutely delightful, and I'm glad I stumbled across it. I hope it interests and bemuses you as much as it did me.
