description: A humorous sci-fi take on Earth's naming conventions and the prevalence of water and aquatic life.
---

It's always bothered me that the sci-fi name for Earth is ["Terra"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetTerra).

Terra comes from the Latin word terra, meaning land, soil, or dirt.

The implication is that, from a cosmic perspective, Earth is remarkable mainly for its dirt.

I disagree.

<div class="chat">
<p class="a">We found another life-harboring planet!</p>
<p class="b">Oh, cool! Which star system?</p>
<p class="a">Sol</p>
<p class="b">Isn't that the star that with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon">polar hexagon</a> planet?</p>
<p class="a">Saturn, yeah</p>
<p class="b">So what kind of life? More crabs?</p>
<p class="a">Nope! Well, yes. But there's also a bunch of others ones that haven't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">evolved into crabs</a> yet</p>
<p class="b">Oh?</p>
<p class="a">Yep. The primary lifeforms are bipeds. From what we've seen, they like concrete and cats</p>
<p class="b">What are cats?</p>
<p class="a">They're another new lifeform. They like fish</p>
<p class="b">And what are fish?</p>
<p class="a">Another lifeform. They have little tails they use to swim</p>
<p class="b">Hold on--did you say swim? In what?</p>
<p class="a">Liquid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_parody">dihydrogen monoxide</a>. a.k.a water</p>
<p class="b">Water? What a specfic niche</p>
<p class="a">Not really. about 71% of the planet's surface is water. It makes the planet blue</p>
<p class="b">how</p>
<p class="a">Also its like 10km deep in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_Deep">some parts</a></p>
<p class="b">How did the water get there?</p>
<p class="a">Fusion from hydrogen in the protoplanetary disk. Also maybe from asteroid bombardment</p>
<p class="b">How does the water stay liquid? Wouldn't it get vaporized by the sun?</p>
<p class="a">It does. The water vapor is lighter than the ambient atmosphere so it floats upwards and collects into megastructures that we're calling 'clouds' that hover a few kilometers above the planet surface</p>
<p class="b">No seriously</p>
<p class="a">I am being serious. It's the white stuff in this picture <img src="../../images\earth_far_away.webp" alt="An image of the Earth from orbit"></p>
<p class="b">What!?</p>
<p class="a">Yeah, we found it hard to believe too</p>
<p class="b">So that's collected over billions of years, right?</p>
<p class="a">Nope. All of the vapor in those clouds was liquid about 10 days ago at the latest</p>
<p class="b">How is there any water left?</p>
<p class="a">If enough of the water was clouds, the clouds would block out the sun and stop more water from being vaporized.</p>
<p class="b">What prevents that from happening?</p>
<p class="a">The vapor at the bottom of the clouds doesn't get enough sunlight to keep it vaporous and so it condenses back into water</p>
<p class="b">So does it just fall from the sky?</p>
<p class="a">Pretty much. The bipeds have to make sure that all of their buildings have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gable_roof">slanted roofs</a> 'cause otherwise water pools up and collapses the roof</p>
<p class="a">Couldn't they use the falling water for power?</p>
<p class="b">They do. Rather than building continent-sized funnels, they let the land channel water into rivers, then build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity">big concrete wall</a> with electric dynamos at the top</p>
<p class="a">So they're basically using the entire ocean as a solar panel</p>
<p class="b">Yeah. Oh, and they also make their own clouds for electricity by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor">heating up water with uranium</a></p>
<p class="a">That must require huge amounts of water</p>
<p class="b">Not actually that much. The biped's biggest use for water is for sustaining lifeforms</p>
<p class="a">?</p>
<p class="b">All lifeforms on this planet need water to stay alive. Most of them perish in a few days if they don't ingest water.</p>
<p class="a">Are you joking? I can't tell</p>
<p class="b">I'm not. The bipeds are about 60% water</p>
<p class="a">What do you mean? Are they made of water!?</p>
<p class="b">Yeah</p>
<p class="a">This is too bizarre. Have you thought of a name for the planet yet? Might I suggest Thalassa because of the water?</p>
<p class="b">Nah, we're going with Terra because there's some dirt on the land in between the water</p>

## Conclusion

First of all, yes, these aliens use the Metric system. I figured that using [my absolute measurement system](../quanth) would be detrimental to readbility.

Also, the links aren't canonically present; they're for your convenience in case you want to do further reading.

This post was mainly an experiment with using media other than plain text and images (stylized text messages, in this case). If I ever need write out a text chain in a future post, I can just use the styles from this post!

Stay hydrated.
