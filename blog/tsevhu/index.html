<p>I found a language written with fish.</p>
<img alt="A poem written in Tsevhu" src="../../images/tsevhu_poem.svg" />
<p><em>Disclaimer: I only kind of understand how Tsevhu works, so my explanation is probably partially inaccurate.</em></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>According to the inventor Tsevhu, Koa Vhukva, the fishes in the poem above translate to:</p>
<poem><p>"When I traveled the world,</p><p>I traveled lonely.</p><p>A desolate landscape</p><p>scraped my view,</p><p>A dead thing to keep me company.</p><p>I wandered because</p><p>it was the only thing left to do.</p><p>When I found you,</p><p>you were in stasis,</p><p>frozen for more</p><p>than a century</p><p>asleep, delicate in all your graces,</p><p>and I felt all my years</p><p>telling me to wake you."</p></poem>

<p>This is a lovely little poem, but what's interesting is how it's encoded with fish.</p>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<img alt="A Tsevhu grammar chart" src="../../images/tsevhu_grammar.webp" />
<h3>Clauses</h3>
<p>Basically, each fish represents a clause. If you don't know what a clause is, you can think of it as a sentence (it's not but whatever)</p>
<p>The fish's orientation represents one of the eight tenses:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Orientation</th>
<th>Tense</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Northwest</td>
<td>Remote past</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>North</td>
<td>Historical Future</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Northeast</td>
<td>Remote Future</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>East</td>
<td>Future</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Southeast</td>
<td>Near future</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>South</td>
<td>Present</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Southwest</td>
<td>Near past</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>West</td>
<td>Past</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The base of the tail indicates verb type (base, perfective, continuous).</p>
<p>The tip of the tail indicates clause mood (declarative, interrogative, imperative).</p>
<p>There are also smaller fish that represent subordinate clauses, but that's beyond the scope of this explanation.</p>
<h3>Morphemes</h3>
<p>The floating ripples around each fish represent <strong>Morphemes</strong>, which are basically individual concepts. Morphemes are somewhere in between letters and words.</p>
<p>When speaking Tsevhu, each ripple is a phoneme.</p>
<p>Proximate ripples combine to form words.</p>
<h3>Dictionary</h3>
<p>Tsevhu has 3429 official words so far.</p>
<p>This is obviously too many for me to put in this blog post, so I'll just provide a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z3GgLvUsjAupx9l_Zo0lBfozFwRk_K_gE6kCBJmuU3Y">link to the official dictionary</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tsevhu is a cool little language. I'm glad I stumbled upon this corner of the internet; conlang linguists are really creative.</p>

<poem><p>"I'm glad</p><p>To have met you all.</p><p>I feel grateful for</p><p>The interest you have shown in Tsevhu.</p><p>I wish to thank you all."</p></poem>
