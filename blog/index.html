<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><b>Blog</b> (noun) - an online journal of thoughts</p>
<p>This is my blog. I use it to share things that I've written, usually devlogs and essays.</p>
<p>I tend to write in an essayistic format, but I've tried to make my posts fun to read and accessible by including humor and images and by minimizing jargon. I have been questionably successful at this.</p>
<p>I wrote this blog for anyone else who shares my interests. I enjoy small personal blogs about things that interest me, and I wanted to make one of my own.</p>
