            <article class="animated"><p><a href="https://github.com/Huage001/PaintTransformer" target="_blank">PaintTransformer</a> is a neural network that approximates images using paint strokes. This gives it a very pretty and stylized watercolor/painterly aesthetic.</p>
<p>I like how this looks, and I'll sometimes just run random photos through it to see how they turn out.</p>
<figure><img alt="A highly stylized watercolour-style image of a concrete walkway runs alongside a dense hedge of flowering bushes, all under a sleek red pergola." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColourlessSpearmint/ColourlessTransformer/main/images/walkway_painttransformer.jpg" /></figure>
<p>Another cool thing you can do is save each step as a frame, which creates a cool animation similar to a <a href="https://youtu.be/1rc0qmqcqMY" target="_blank">watercolor timelapse</a>.</p>
<p>Because of how PaintTransformer works, the brush size gets smaller and smaller as times goes on (so that it can add details), but this makes for a fun charades-like game: <em>how quickly can you guess what it's painting?</em></p>

<p>PaintTransformer was developed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03798" target="_blank">this paper</a> by a team of researchers. It was later <a href="https://github.com/Huage001/PaintTransformer" target="_blank">implemented in PyTorch</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Huage001" target="_blank">Huage001</a></p>
<p>I wanted to use PaintTransformer, but my makeshift solution of uploading files to a Colab runtime was too clunky to be used at scale. So I instead decided to build a custom interface. I named it ColourlessTransformer because I was going through a phase of naming everything eponymously after <a href="/blog/username">my username</a>.</p>
<h2>Streamlit</h2>
<p>This was my first time working with <a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a>. I originally planned to use <a href="https://www.gradio.app/" target="_blank">Gradio</a> for this project because I had previous experience, but Gradio is an extremely heavy framework for my use case, and the 2-minute starting times were bothering me. I'm quite happy with how the it turned out.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>If you want to try this out on your own, follow the <a href="https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint/ColourlessTransformer?tab=readme-ov-file#usage" target="_blank">instructions in the README</a>. You'll need Git, Python, a GPU, and some familiarity with the terminal.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<figure><img alt="Two images of the Seattle Space Needle, side-by-side. The left image is an photo, and the one on the right is is heavily stylized and painterly image generated by PaintTransformer" src="/media/painttransformer_space_needle_comparison.webp" /></figure>
<p>ColourlessTransformer was one of my favorite projects because I started with a complex task that took 3-5 minutes of tedious parameter filling and file reorganization and ended with a sleek, fast, and painless custom application.</p>
<p>Apparently it wasn't enough to automate watercolor; I also had to automate the automation.</p>
