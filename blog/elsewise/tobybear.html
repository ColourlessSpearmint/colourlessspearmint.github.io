<h1 class="mint">Editing my Cat into a Painting</h1>

<p>Last December, I went to the <a href="https://crystalbridges.org/">Crystal Bridges Art Museum</a>. They had all sorts of interesting things there (like <a href="https://images.crystalbridges.org/uploads/2021/08/SEI20210514_0082-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024">a pond intentionally filled with hundreds of large steel balls</a>), but one exhibit in particular caught my attention.</p>

<p>It's a painting of a bear attacking a guy. Nothing special. What caught my attention wasn't what it was, but what it wasn't. I first saw the painting from across the gallery and I thought that the bear was a housecat. I realized my mistake when I moved closer, but the error stayed with me.</p>

<h2>First Attempt</h2>
<p>About a month after seeing the painting, I had the idea to edit my cat, Toby, into the painting in place of the bear.</p>
<p>At the time, I was still <i>very</i> new to photo editing, so my workflow was hacky.</p>
<p>To remove the bear, I uploaded the photo to Google Photos, used <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/photos/editing/">Magic Eraser</a> to remove the bear, then downloaded it back to my computer.</p>
<p>Then I opened a photo of Toby in <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, manually traced a selection around Toby and deleted everything outside of that selection. I then foolishly exported it in the non-alpha-supporting JPEG format and had to do it again (I used the JPEG for the juxtapose below because its a smaller file).</p>

<figure>
    <div class="juxtapose-container">
        <div class="juxtapose" style="width: 500px;">
            <img src="images/toby_bojangles.jpg">
            <img src="images/toby_bojangles_transparent.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
    <script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {juxtapose.scanPage();});</script>
    <figcaption>My first attempt at removing the background from this Toby photo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now that I had a transparent-background graphic of Toby, I pasted it onto the bear-less painting. I used GIMP's perspective transform tool to try and line up the corner, but it still looks wierd.</p>
<figure>
    <div class="juxtapose-container">
        <div class="juxtapose" style="width: 500px;">
            <img src="images/bear_painting.jpg">
            <img src="images/bear_painting_result1.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
    <script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {juxtapose.scanPage();});</script>
    <figcaption>Result 1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a completely acceptable result. It doesn't look convincing (Toby is hovering above the ground, the lighting is wrong, no eye contact, etc.), but that was never the point. It would be ridiculous to spend any more time on this.</p>

<h2>Second Attempt</h2>
<p>So today I spent some more time on it.</p>
<p>Over the past three weeks, I've spent a few hours (in total, not per week) learning Adobe Photoshop. This means that I'm at least <i>somewhat</i> more skilled at photo manipulation now than I was in January.</p>
<p>To be continued...</p>
