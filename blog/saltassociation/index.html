<p>Salt is my favorite mineral. It's easily the most delicious (Sitenote: despite its name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnabar">Cinnabar</a> is actually not tasty at all), it <a href="https://salinity.oceansciences.org/images/ed_image_81_salt_crystal.jpg">looks awesome under an electron microscope</a>, and it's so abundant that it forms colossal salt caverns and vast salt flats.</p>
<img alt="A large, textured salt flat with polygonal patterns stretches to a distant mountain range under a vibrant orange and blue sunset sky" src="https://149576366.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Salar_de_Uyuni_in_Bolivia.jpg" />
<p>Yesterday (June 10, 2025), I discovered that the top result on Google Images for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=salt+flat&amp;udm=2">"Salt Flat"</a> is this beautiful photo of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni">Uyuni Salt Flat</a>. It is currently set as my desktop wallpaper.</p>
<p>Although the image content is interesting, what interested me even more was the image source: a website called "The Salt Association". Intrigued, I clicked on the link.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I was else expecting, but I was delighted to find <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/">an entire multi-page website devoted entirely to salt</a>. </p>
<h2>The Salt Association</h2>
<img alt="The word &quot;SALT&quot; is spelled out using four different types of salt on a dark background: coarse white salt for 'S', pink Himalayan salt for 'A', black salt for 'L', and fine white salt for 'T'" src="https://149576366.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/salt-text-in-salt.jpg" />
<p>The Salt Association's website explores a variety of topics, including <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/what-is-salt-and-its-properties/">the basic properties of salt</a>, its <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/de-icing/">applications in de-icing roads</a>, its <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/white-salt/">culinary use as table salt</a>, its <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/salt-history/early-history/">history as a valuable commodity</a> that soldiers were paid in (the word 'salary' comes from the Latin word for salt, 'sal'), and much more.</p>
<p>It explains <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/make-salt/">how salt is mined</a>, where the <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/physical-geography/">biggest salt reserves are</a>, and the <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/chemistry-salt/">different types of salt</a> other than Sodium Chloride.</p>
<img alt="Several enormous piles of gleaming white salt surround an industrial yellow salt elevator" src="https://149576366.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/salt-production.jpg" />
<p>It covers various <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/education/physical-geography/">famous geological salt formations</a>, like the salt flats that brought me to this website in the first place.</p>
<p>It even covers <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/position-statement-government-salt-reduction-strategy/">salt controversies</a> and combats <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/salt-the-facts/">salt misinformation</a>.</p>
<img alt="A 404 page with the header &quot;404 Error&quot; in large red text, and below it the subheader &quot;You’ve found a lost salt crystal!&quot; in smaller blue text. To the right is a photo of a salt crystal." src="../../images/salt_404.webp" />
<p>The <a href="https://saltassociation.co.uk/404">404 page</a> says "You’ve found a lost salt crystal!". I thought <a href="https://colourlessspearmint.github.io/404">my 404 page</a> was great, but this one is clearly far superior.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think that the Salt Association's website is an exceptional demonstration of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1095/">"human subcultures are nestled fractally. There is no bottom"</a>: it was created by an association that represents the work of six specific salt extraction companies, each employing many hundreds of people whose entire working lives are centered around salt, all so that we can have table salt.</p>
<p>I hope you find their website as bemusing and interesting as I did.</p>
