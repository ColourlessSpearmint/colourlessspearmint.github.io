<img alt="An xkcd comic describing a cipher where encrypted messages consist of only the letter 'A', with different diacritics applied to the 'A' to represent each plaintext letter of the alphabet" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/scream_cipher.png" />
<p>This is one of my favorite <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> comics. It proposes the <a href="https://xkcd.com/3054/">Scream Cipher</a>, a creative, amusing, and not <em>completely</em> useless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">cipher</a>.</p>
<p>The Scream Cipher works by assigning each letter of the alphabet to a unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritical</a> variant of the letter A. For example, "THIS IS SOME EXAMPLE TEXT" becomes "ĀA̰ẢÃ ẢÃ ÃÅǍÁ ÁA̽AǍA̯ĂÁ ĀÁA̽Ā".</p>
<p>The punchline in the comic is that attempting to pronounce the encrypted text would sound like screaming (<a href="https://xkcd.com/2957/">AAAAAAAAAAA</a>).</p>
<p>The Scream Cipher isn't great for actually making secret messages due to a lack of a key (although you could shift the diacritic dictionary with a 26-combination key to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a>), but it is a pretty good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">obfuscation</a> technique. If you hadn't heard of the Scream Cipher and you encountered Scream-encrypted text, you probably wouldn't even know that there was a secret message; you would just think it was something akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalgo_text">Zalgo text</a>.</p>
<p>This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle">Kerckhoffs-insecure</a> cipher, and it's a demonstration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">Security through Obscurity</a>. The crucial part of any encryption or security system is that you have something or know something that other people don't. Generally, this is a physical key or a secret password. With Kerckhoffs-insecurity, the special information is about how the system works. You can assume that a hacker knows how a password works, so you need to choose a strong password. If your encryption method is so obscure and stupid that nobody other than you knows how to use it, you don't need a password at all.</p>
<h2>Converter</h2>
<img alt="a screenshot of the Scream Cipher Converter interface" src="/media/screamcipher_screenshot.webp" />
<p>Anyways, I built a <a href="https://colourlessspearmint.github.io/screamcipher.html">Scream Cipher converter webpage</a> to automate the process of ciphering in Scream Cipher.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go to the Scream Cipher Converter webpage</strong>: <a href="https://colourlessspearmint.github.io/screamcipher.html">https://colourlessspearmint.github.io/screamcipher.html</a></li>
<li><strong>Input Text</strong>: Type or paste the text you want to convert. It can be either plaintext or encrypted text; the program will detect it automatically. The conversion happens automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>: You can press the clipboard icon above the result area to copy the text to your clipboard.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>For the sake of simplicity and thoroughness, my converter has a few quirks.</p>
<ul>
<li>All lowercase letters are treated as though they were uppercase.</li>
<li>Non-letters characters (like numbers and punctuation) are left unmodified.</li>
<li>An error is thrown if non-ASCII unicode characters (like emoji) are detected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
