description: An explanation of my username, ColourlessSpearmint
---

This site's URL is ["ethmarks.github.io"](https://ethmarks.github.io/). The ".github.io" part is because it's hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the "colourlessspearmint" comes from my username, [ColourlessSpearmint](https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint).

My username is primarily a reference to a novel called [*There Is No Antimemetics Division*](https://qntm.org/scp) by [Sam Hughes](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8352985.Sam_Hughes), one of my favorite authors. One of the chapters is titled "[CASE COLOURLESS GREEN](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/case-colourless-green)". I thought that sounded interesting and [oxymoronic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oxymoron), so I decided to shamelessly steal it.

The "spearmint" references from my favorite colour, Spearmint Teal.

I came up with it on a whim on September 26, 2024, when I was trying to think up a semi-quasi-sort-of-professional-sounding (i.e. not named after my favorite animal) username for my [Github](https://github.com/) account. I've stuck with it out of inertia and to build a consistent online presence.
