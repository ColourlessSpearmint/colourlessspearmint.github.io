[PaintTransformer](https://github.com/Huage001/PaintTransformer) is a neural network that approximates images using paint strokes. This gives it a very pretty and stylized watercolor/painterly aesthetic.

I like how this looks, and I'll sometimes just run random photos through it to see how they turn out.

Another cool thing you can do is save each step as a frame, which creates a cool animation similar to a [watercolor timelapse](https://youtu.be/1rc0qmqcqMY).

Because of how PaintTransformer works, the brush size gets smaller and smaller as times goes on (so that it can add details), but this makes for a fun charades-like game: *how quickly can you guess what it's painting?*

PaintTransformer was developed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03798) by a team of researchers. It was later [implemented in PyTorch](https://github.com/Huage001/PaintTransformer) by [Huage001](https://github.com/Huage001)

I wanted to use PaintTransformer, but my makeshift solution of uploading files to a Colab runtime was too clunky to be used at scale. So I instead decided to build a custom interface. I named it ColourlessTransformer because I was going through a phase of naming everything eponymously after [my username](/blog/username).

## Streamlit

This was my first time working with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). I originally planned to use [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for this project because I had previous experience, but Gradio is an extremely heavy framework for my use case, and the 2-minute starting times were bothering me. I'm quite happy with how the it turned out.

## Usage

If you want to try this out on your own, follow the [instructions in the README](https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint/ColourlessTransformer?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). You'll need Git, Python, a GPU, and some familiarity with the terminal.

## Conclusion

ColourlessTransformer was one of my favorite projects because I started with a complex task that took 3-5 minutes of tedious parameter filling and file reorganization and ended with a sleek, fast, and painless custom application.

Apparently it wasn't enough to automate watercolor; I also had to automate the automation.
