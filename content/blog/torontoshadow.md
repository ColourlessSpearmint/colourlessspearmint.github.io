Early in the morning, from certain viewpoints, the [CN Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower) in [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto) casts a volumetric shadow in the air.

The photo above was taken by me on May 24, 2024, at 9:26 AM, standing in [this location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s5EvpEsEkwLTvgqC8), just to the north of the [Rogers Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Centre). It is one of my favorite photos.

## Volumetric Light and Shadow

Think about a spotlight for a moment. Normally, you only see the illuminated area where the beam lands. However, if the spotlight shines through a cloud of smoke or steam, the light scatters off the particles, making the beam visible in the air. This effect is known as [volumetric lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_lighting), and it only appears when the air is filled with particles.

If we substitute the spotlight for the sun and introduce an object that blocks the light, like a cloud, we get [crepuscular rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays): a form of natural volumetric lighting. Crepuscular rays are *awesome*, and I completely understand why they're colloquially referred to as "God rays".

Crepuscular rays occur when the sun is at an oblique angle (so during during dawn or dusk) and the air is filled with particles. Any airborne panicles will do, but the most common ones are smoke and mist.

## Air Pollution

The airborne particles in my CN tower photo were caused by the air pollution in Toronto. Toronto has remarkably clean air for a city of 3 million people (Toronto has an [AQI](https://www.iqair.com/) of only [23](https://www.iqair.com/us/canada/ontario/toronto)), but it still evidently has enough airborne particulates to cause their giant tower to cast a volumetric shadow.

My photo was the most pretty and photogenic demonstration of air pollution I've seen, but it's not even close to the most interesting. For example, the air in China is thick enough to [cast rainbow lasers over the highway to keep drivers awake](https://www.drive.com.au/news/video-china-testing-anti-sleep-laser-display-on-highway/).

## Conclusion

As it turns out, I wasn't the first person to notice this. 10 years ago, the [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation) published [a story about a very similar photo](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/what-was-this-beam-radiating-from-the-cn-tower-1.3242665) of the CN Tower casting a volumetric shadow. 

Where's the news article for *my* photo, CBC?
