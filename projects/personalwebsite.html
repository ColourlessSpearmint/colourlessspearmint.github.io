<article>
<p>My personal website is my home on the web.</p>
<figure>
    <iframe src="../index.html" scrolling="no" style="pointer-events: none;"></iframe>
</figure>
<p>I made this site because I want to have an online presence, but I don't want to use social media (e.g. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>), nor do I want to use someone else's premade blogging framework (e.g. <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>).</p>
<p>My solution was to code an entire site from scratch.</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>
<p>This site is completely static and is written entirely in pure vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>It doesn't use any external libraries, nor does it use any frameworks.</p>

<h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
<p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I chose GitHub Pages because it's free, seems reputable, and I was already going to use GitHub for source control.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<h3>Unbuilt</h3>
<p>My website doesn't have a build step (other than stock GitHub Pages deployment); the source HTML files are the same as what gets deployed. My motivation for doing this was mostly comprised of aversion to frameworks. I didn't want to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (in fact, I tried to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Hyde</a> from it entirely). I would have been fine with using a templating language like <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>, but then I would have had to learn <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> YAML scripting.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided it was preferable to just author each page in HTML. The words you're reading right now were written in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> (my preferred code editor) instead of <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (my preferred text editor). The trade-off is that each page must have a bunch of redundant and repetitive tags (in contrast to Markdown where it's pure content). I <s>solved</s> "good-enoughed" this by just creating a <code>template.html</code> file and duplicating it whenever I created a new page.</p>

<h3>Web Components</h3>
<p>I've utilized <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</a> for things like the header, footer, and buttons.</p>
<p>This has allowed me to just add an <code>&lt;ethan-header&gt;</code> element, and the header is instantiated in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM">Shadow DOM</a>. Otherwise, I would have to write out the code for the entire header on every single page. This would not only be unnecessarily verbose, but would also mean that I couldn't rework the header without updating every single instance on every single page.</p>

<h2>Style Guide</h2>
<p>I had a moderately specific vision for what I wanted my website to look like, and I think I accomplished that well with <a href="https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint/colourlessspearmint.github.io/blob/main/common.css">500+ lines of CSS</a>.</p>
<h3>Color Palette</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Primary</b>: <span class="white"><b>#ffffff</b></span>: White.</li>
    <li><b>Backdrop</b>: <span class="black"><b>#121212</b></span>: Black.</li>
    <li><b>Accent</b>: <span class="teal"><b>#8fdfd4</b></span>: Spearmint Teal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Body Font</b>: I perused the <i>entire</i> <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> catalogue to find a sleek <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/grotesque_neo_grotesque">neo-grotesque</a> font that supported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script">Latin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script">Cyrillic</a>. I finally settled on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito">Nunito</a>. (Заслужаваше си, защото вече мога да имам български текст!)</li>
    <li><b>Header Font</b>: I chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sen">Sen</a> for the headers because it looks stylish, clean, and I like the look of the lowercase <span class="sen mint"><b>t</b></span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Animations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Page Load</b>: Every time a page loads, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> fades in from transparency in 0.3 seconds.</li>
    <li><b>Home Page</b>: My <a href="../">Home Page</a> has 4 animations. I'm very happy with how they turned out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effects</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Blur</b>: I love <a href="https://css.glass/">glassmorphic</a> blur effects, but due to performance concerns, I've only used it in the header and footer. If some mathematician figures out how to efficiently take a gaussian blur over a large sample space, I want to be the first to know so I can add a subtle blur to the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> styles without tanking performance.</li>
    <li><b>Shadows</b>: Unless an object is interactive, (e.g. buttons), it doesn't have a drop shadow.</li>
    <li><b>Borders</b>: Many elements (buttons, images, articles) have this border <code>border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)</code>; it's 1 pixel thick, 10% opaque, and pure white.</li>
    <li><b>Rounded Corners</b>: Many elements have slightly rounded corners. The radius is defined with <code>border-radius: clamp(8px, 3vw, 12px)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lighthouse</h2>
<p>As of May 14, 2025, the site earns an average <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> score of 96.4</p>
<figure>
    <img src="images/lighthouse.webp" alt="A Lighthouse analytic page showing 95 performance, 100 accessibility, 100 best practices, 91 SEO">
    <figcaption>2025-05-14 <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-colourlessspearmint-github-io/x6c865vinn?form_factor=desktop">Lighthouse Analysis</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The missing points in performance are due to the animations on the home screen that cause <a href="https://web.dev/articles/cls">Cumulative Layout Shift</a>. I could fix it by removing the animations, but I'm hesitant to sacrifice their aesthetic value for a small nominal performance gain.</p>
<p>The missing points in SEO are because I don't have <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> description tags on every page. I'm working on rectifying this; I just haven't got around to it yet.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>This site does not use cookies, trackers, analytics, or any external telemetry tools. This is partially because I care about your privacy, but mostly because I don't care about your personal information and harvesting it sounds complicated. Your data remains yours because I don't want it and can't figure out how to get it.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>This site is designed to be accessible to as many users as possible. Before each <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push">git push</a>, I test every single page in Firefox's <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/">Responsive Design Mode</a> to ensure that the site remains functional on a variety of devices. I've done my best to follow best practices regarding semantic markup, keyboard navigation, and alt text.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My personal website is one of my favorite projects I've ever made. It's aesthetically pleasing, serves a purpose, was fun to make, and forced me to learn new programming concepts.</p>
<p>I'm proud of my little corner on the web, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading.</p>
