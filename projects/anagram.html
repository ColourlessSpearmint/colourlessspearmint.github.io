<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram">Anagram</a> is a word created by rearranging the letters of another word.</p>
<p>For example, my full name, 'Ethan Oliver Marks', is an anagram for 'Martin Kolver Shea'.</p>

    <img src="images/example_anagram.gif" alt="An animation of 'Ethan Oliver Marks' rearranging to 'Martin Kolver Shea'">
    <figcaption>Ethan Oliver Marks â†’ Martin Kolver Shea</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I generated the above animation using a Colab Notebook I wrote in a few hours.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>I mainly made this project because my friends were making anagrams of our names one day and I wanted to contribute by making visualizations. None of my friends are programmers, so I specifically designed the notebook to be as easy to use as possible.</p>
<p>These instructions are also in the notebook.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Come up with an anagram</li>
    <li>Fill in the parameter form with your start and end words (must be anagrams; will get an error otherwise)</li>
    <li>Run the cell by pressing the little circle in the top left corner</li>
    <li>Press <b>Run Anyway</b> on the pop up box that appears</li>
    <li>Please be patient while the code generates the GIF; it could take up to a minute</li>
    <li>When it's finished, the code will automatically render and download the finished GIF</li>
</ol>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Input Validation</b>: Make sure that the start and end words are valid anagrams</li>
    <li><b>Character Mapping</b>: Figure out where each character should move to</li>
    <li><b>Render Frames</b>: Render each frame of the animation by interpolating between the start and end positions of each character</li>
    <li><b>Compile Frames</b>: Compile each frame into a GIF</li>
    <li><b>Display and Download</b>: Display the finished GIF and download it to the user's device</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Other anagram animators exist--most notably the <a href="https://wordsmith.org/anagram/animation.html">Internet Anagram Server</a>--but all the ones I looked at had some sort of major flaw (e.g. low frame rate, opaque backdrop, etc.) which was enough of a dealbreaker that I decided to write 300 lines of Python to make my own. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
