[ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) was the first computer chatbot. Think of it as the great-great-great-grandparent of ChatGPT.

ELIZA's source code was written by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 in the [SLIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIP_(programming_language)) programming language, which is a fork of [MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAD_(programming_language)). My computer obviously doesn't run a 66-year-old programming language written for the [UNIVAC 1100/2200 series#1107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_1100/2200_series#1107).

I still wanted to test ELIZA as part of my [research on early AI](../blog/curios/earlyai.html), so I was left no other choice but to re-implement ELIZA for modern computers in Python.
