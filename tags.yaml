    This blog is for personal essays on things I find interesting. For creative writing, check out Figments, for computery things I've made, check out Projects, and for miscellaneous posts check out Elsewise.
    
    I made this blog because I want to share the stuff I've made, but don't want to use social media.

    This blog is for any creative writing pieces I've made, such as short stories or poems. For computery things I've made, check out Projects, for interesting things I've found check out Curios, and for miscellaneous posts check out Elsewise.
    
    Many of the works were created long before I made this blog, and accordingly have publication dates predating that of this site.
